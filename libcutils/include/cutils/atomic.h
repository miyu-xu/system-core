/*
 * A handful of basic atomic operations.
 * THESE ARE HERE FOR LEGACY REASONS ONLY.  AVOID.
 *
 * PREFERRED ALTERNATIVES:
 * - Use C++/C/pthread locks/mutexes whenever there is not a
 *   convincing reason to do otherwise.  Note that very clever and
 *   complicated, but correct, lock-free code is often slower than
 *   using locks, especially where nontrivial data structures
 *   are involved.
 * - C11 stdatomic.h.
 * - Where supported, C++11 std::atomic<T> .
 *
 * PLEASE STOP READING HERE UNLESS YOU ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
 * OR UPDATE OLD CODE.
 *
 * The "acquire" and "release" terms can be defined intuitively in terms
 * of the placement of memory barriers in a simple lock implementation:
 *   - wait until compare-and-swap(lock-is-free --> lock-is-held) succeeds
 *   - barrier
 *   - [do work]
 *   - barrier
 *   - store(lock-is-free)
 * In very crude terms, the initial (acquire) barrier prevents any of the
 * "work" from happening before the lock is held, and the later (release)
 * barrier ensures that all of the work happens before the lock is released.
 * (Think of cached writes, cache read-ahead, and instruction reordering
 * around the CAS and store instructions.)
 *
 * The barriers must apply to both the compiler and the CPU.  Note it is
 * legal for instructions that occur before an "acquire" barrier to be
 * moved down below it, and for instructions that occur after a "release"
 * barrier to be moved up above it.
 *
 * The ARM-driven implementation we use here is short on subtlety,
 * and actually requests a full barrier from the compiler and the CPU.
 * The only difference between acquire and release is in whether they
 * are issued before or after the atomic operation with which they
 * are associated.  To ease the transition to C/C++ atomic intrinsics,
 * you should not rely on this, and instead assume that only the minimal
 * acquire/release protection is provided.
 *
 * NOTE: all int32_t* values are expected to be aligned on 32-bit boundaries.
 * If they are not, atomicity is not guaranteed.
